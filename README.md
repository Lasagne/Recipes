Recipes
=========

This is a collection of recipes for using [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne). Code snippets, IPython notebooks, tutorials and useful extensions are welcome here.

Organization
------------

* Examples: short examples demonstrating how to accomplish something interesting with Lasagne.
* Tutorials: longer examples covering a range of topics.
* Papers: code implementing a new technique or replicating results of a specific paper.
* Model Zoo: a collection of pretrained models.
* Utils: helper functions which can be imported.
* Stale: things that break due to api changes will live here until they can be updated. Hopefully empty.
