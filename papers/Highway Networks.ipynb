    "# Highway networks\n",
    "**A quick example of how to implement [highway networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00387) in Lasagne.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's a highway network?\n",
    "The paper linked above introduces a new type of neural network layer, which works roughly as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be the input to a layer. Then a typical neural network layer computes some nonlinear transform of this input $y = H(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A highway layer also computes an additional nonlinear transform $T(x)$, which in practice is constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$. The output of the layer is then $y = T(x) \\cdot H(x) + (1 - T(x)) \\cdot x$, where the multiplication is elementwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, **depending on the gate values $T(x)$, the layer behaves as a traditional layer would ($T(x) = 1$), or passes its input through unchanged ($T(x) = 0$)**. This idea is inspired by the gates in LSTM units. According to the authors, **it enables gradient descent-based training of much deeper networks** with as many as 900 layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a highway layer needs to have as many outputs as inputs: the shapes of $x$, $H(x)$ and $T(x)$ all have to have matching shapes. To change the dimensionality in a highway network, the authors suggest inserting a traditional neural network layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "I read the paper before and wanted to try it out. I figured this would be a good way of showing how to implement a new concept or idea in Lasagne. **This use case of trying out new ideas and implementing new types of layers is extremely important to the Lasagne development team, and we are trying to make it as easy as possible to use Lasagne in this way.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "I decided to implement this idea in two steps. First, I added a `MultiplicativeGatingLayer`, which performs the following operation: $y(t, x_1, x_2) = t \\cdot x_1 + (1 - t) \\cdot x_2$. In other words, the first input $t$ multiplicatively gates between the others $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This then makes it possible to use any layer we like for computing $t$ and $x_1$ (and $x_2$ is taken to be the output of the previous layer). I implemented two \"macro functions\" on top of this: `highway_dense` and `highway_conv2d`. They create fully connected and 2D convolutional highway layers respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-step approach allows for some code reuse and easy implementation of different types of highway layers."
